Each of these files contains exactly 1000 cells.
All files here are of the format
```
cells_<epithelial_tumor_weight>_<fibroblast_weight>
```
So that, for example, in `cells_10_1.csv` there are initially 10 `epithelial_tumor` cells for every 1 `fibroblast` cell.

In `cells_only_tumor.csv`, there are initially only `epithelial_tumor` cells.
